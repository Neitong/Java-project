1. Add product To store or we can call say add product to file
    +ALgorithms
_I have created ArrayList to store data from constructor, from file, and assign them to it at some conditions
_I have created temporary class to store data for user to input, get data from file, assign data to constructor,
but it is just a short time that we need it.
_I use try and catch because to prevent error that file do no match
    +Flows and Structure
_First it go to the specific file and give admin to input product info
_After they inputed, all data they provided i have stored it in temp class and assign it to constuctors to match
the specific parameter
_In the ArrayList , i have store one obj by one obj, it meant that all the specific info in products is store in
package by package, and i store them in ArrayList, which easy to control
_After store temporary in ArrayList, i insert all package that have the specific data from products to file.

2. Update Products
